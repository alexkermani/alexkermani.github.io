						Hello! I'm Alex. I'm a 28 year old dude who grew up in beautiful Wisconsin. When I was 18, I got
						on a
						plane and flew to sunny California where I worked and went to community college in LA. My Dad
						and sister
						also lived nearby. I transferred to UC Santa Barbara where I studied Chemical Engineering and
						Materials Science. I currently
						work in pharmaceutical research and development. I'm taking this class online so that I can
						study on the evenings
						and weekends. I'm excited to be busy!</p>
