						Hello! I'm Alex. I'm a 28 year old dude who grew up in beautiful Wisconsin. When I was 18, I got on a
						plane and flew to sunny California where I worked and went to community college in LA. My Dad and sister
						also lived nearby. I transferred to UC Santa Barbara where I studied Chemical Engineering and Materials Science. I currently
						work in pharmaceutical research and development. I'm taking this class online so that I can study on the evenings
						and weekends. I'm excited to be busy!</p>
				</div>
				<p style="clear: both">I'm taking this class so that I can learn marketable and transferrable skills in computer
					science. I have several ideas for projects I'd like to work on for myself and I know that this class will help me
					reach my goals! I was pleasently surprised when I saw the Intro Discussion forum where lots of people mentioned
					that this is a required class for a CIS certificate!</p>
